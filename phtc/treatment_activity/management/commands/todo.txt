			So what Susan is doing is basically choosing among the first 2 children of a node. 0 is no and 1 is yes.

			I just need a way to access the labels of the children of the node from the template, as an ordered list.


			OK -- now the values are too short for the database...


			SO change that.

			Also we need to go into the view and figure out wtf is going on.
				apparently there is a next steps structure that is coming from each decision point


			Also I have to comment out / hide / remove from the model and view all the prelimianry crap.
