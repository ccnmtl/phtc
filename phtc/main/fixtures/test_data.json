Text or narrative data can come from a variety of sources, including individual interviews, focus groups, or written responses from open-ended questions on a survey. Analyzing and interpreting textual data is an iterative process that begins during data collection and often continues throughout the later phases of the study.\r\n2. **Direct contact with participants**: During data collection researchers engage with research participants. Methods like in-depth interviews or focus groups, whereby, the researcher is the instrument of data collection provide the study participants with an opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings in their own words to a skilled researcher who is attentive and actively listening. \r\n3. **Design flexibility**: Design flexibility allows researchers to adapt the research design as situations change or to pursue new paths of discovery as they emerge. For example, during data collection you may reach \u201csaturation\u201d or a point when you are no longer hearing or seeing new information from your young respondents. Unlike quantitative researchers who wait until the end of the study to analyze their data, qualitative researchers often analyze their data throughout the study. The design flexibility inherent in qualitative designs allows you to pose new questions or follow up on previously unconsidered topics that your respondents might introduce during data collection. \r\n\r\n But, is there only one way to approach qualitative research?\r\n"

      "body": "### Establish a sampling criteria ###\r\n\r\nSampling was covered in the previous section of this module and it is an important consideration during the data collection planning phase.  A good rule of thumb is to conduct at least two groups with each segment of your population, based on key characteristics. For example, you may determine that the key characteristics of your population HIV positive youth are:\r\n\r\n1. length of time since diagnosis\r\n2. gender and, \r\n3. number or type of medications currently prescribed. \r\n\r\nAccordingly your study might recruit two groups each of participants who are both newly diagnosed and who have been diagnosed for several years. You may also recruit for 2 male groups and 2 female groups. The unit of analysis is another consideration that should play a role in this decision (e.g. you may want to speak only with youth who have attended the adolescent clinic for 6 months or more).  \r\n\r\n### Select a \u201ckey\u201d location ###\r\n\r\nThe location where the groups are held can make or break your ability to get participants to show up for your focus groups. A convenient location for participants should be selected. For example, \r\n\r\n* Since our study will be talking with young participants in an urban area you may want to choose a location that easy to access by public transportation.\u00a0 \r\n* The sensitive nature of the topics under study also requires careful consideration of the acoustics of the room\u2014can passersby easily eavesdrop on your conversation? If so, this may not be an ideal selection. \r\n* If you are holding your groups at the clinic where youth receive services, they may not feel free to discuss openly or honestly topics that portray providers in a negative light. In this instance, it may be better to hold the groups in an off site location. \r\n* You may also want to consider the acoustics of the room where the groups will be held. Is there construction planned nearby? This is of particular concern if you are audio-taping the groups as background noise can often drown out the words of respondents being recorded, which could result in difficulties during the analysis phases of your study.   \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n### Ensure that your moderator has \u201ckey\u201d qualities ###\r\n\r\nModerators should remain neutral and non-judgmental in the face of confidential information and possess the capacity to be sensitive to feelings that are being experienced by respondents. As Boyatzis has noted, \u201cwith certain sources of information, competencies like empathy and social objectivity are crucial to perceiving patterns in a person\u2019s life.\u201d  Some studies have shown that especially for young people, race and gender matching the moderator to the characteristics of the population can help facilitate the flow of conversation and accuracy and quality of information provided by respondents. The best moderator is one that is skilled at active listening and can maintain a focused control of the group.  \u00a0 \r\n\r\n### Develop the question guide ###\r\n\r\nHere are several questions to consider in developing your guide: What are the ultimate goals of the study?  What issues does the study intend to illuminate and what practices will it influence? Why do you want to conduct it and why should we care about the results (i.e. is it worth doing)? Ideally, a focus group guide is developed in a team environment with a work product that is refined several times over. Adapted from McQueen\u2019s (1998) guidance on team based codebook development, the following steps may be utilized in your development of a focus group guide in a team setting: \r\n\r\n* Assign primary responsibility for creating, revising focus group guide to one person \r\n* When generating questions, each team member should generate several variations on one theme (e.g. how the same question may be asked differently to capture the same responses)\r\n* Schedule regular meetings to review questions \r\n* Discard questions that don\u2019t work\r\n* Accept that questions will need to be revised as data collection commences\u00a0 "

You should obtain verbal and written consent for participation from your respondents before the group begins.\r\n\r\n**Record the group**\r\n\r\nThere are several advantages to recording your focus group as it takes place. Experienced focus group moderators recognize that they cannot focus their attention on the structured conversation they are leading while simultaneously writing down the verbatim statements of participants. Recording can save time during the groups by allowing the moderator to actively focus on what is being said. Moreover, audio recording the groups will increase the likelihood that no statements by respondents are missed. A good rule of thumb is to have two recorders, just in case one of the recorders fails. Typically the focus group moderator will build in \u201cwarm up questions\u201d or \u201cice breakers\u201d to put respondents who seem wary of being recorded at ease. \r\n\r\n**Revise your guide as necessary**\r\n\r\nAs described in part one of this module, one of the strengths of qualitative research design is the inherent design flexibility. This allows for new topics previously unconsidered to be interrogated by the moderator. For example, perhaps youth across groups have been describing the similar challenges to medication adherence, like \u201cnot liking the taste of meds.\u201d You may decide to add new questions about a different barrier to adherence reported in fewer groups having reached \u201csaturation\u201d on this topic. Revising the guide does not only mean adding new questions\u2014it may require that you reorder how your questions are delivered. Perhaps you are ending the group on a sour note by asking \u201cWhat is the most stressful thing about living with HIV?\u201d Participants may feel sad or alienated by a question like this, so the timing of such a question is key. Placing a difficult question at the middle of the guide and asking closing questions with a hopeful or optimistic tone like \u201cWhat advice would you give to other HIV positive teens your age?\u201c may help respondents to \u201cfocus on the good\u201d at the end of the focus group instead.

However, transcriptions costs can be one of the most expensive line items on a focus groups study budget. If cost prohibits transcription, listening to the tapes can be just as effective, albeit more time consuming and in some instances, tedious.\r\n\r\n***Identify patterns and themes among and across participants***\r\n\r\nThe processes and techniques involved in the analysis of qualitative data will be described in much further detail during the next section. However, at this juncture it is important to note that an important feature of this process is data reduction. A typical focus group lasting 90 minutes can produce as many as 100 pages! Therefore, during the analysis process the researcher is tasked with reducing this voluminous data to meaningful findings. The approach utilized in this module involves grouping themes into codes to classify the data and then noting patterns between the classifications of data. For example, you might notice a pattern amongst young respondents who haven't disclosed their status consistently reporting barriers to medication adherence because of fear of their status being discovered. During later phases of the analysis, this pattern could be indicative of a larger theme of persistent HIV stigma in the lives of young people despite significant advances in the medical treatment of the disease. \r\n"

It might also include descriptive data, such as whether a respondent has children or not, marital status, and so on. A literal reading allows the analyst to become familiar with the structure and content of the transcript. \r\n\r\n**Reflexive readings** reflect upon how the researcher played a role in the interview.  Reflexivity is an attitude of attending systematically to the effect of the researcher at every step of the research process (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation).  Malterud offers this on the topic of reflectivity in the analysis process: \u201cA researcher's background and position will affect what they choose to investigate, the angle of investigation, the methods judged most adequate for this purpose, the findings considered most appropriate, and the framing and communication of conclusions\u201d (Malterud, 2001, p. 483-484). Reflexive reading can promote a critical engagement and awareness of subjectivity and bias through transcript reading process. \r\n\r\n**Interpretive readings** are perhaps the most crucial type of reading an analyst will conduct. Interpreting is the ability to think abstractly, see patterns, and interrogate emerging patterns. Interpretation is involved in both data collection and data analysis, so the process is iterative. Ultimately analysts complete different types of interpretive readings to inform later analytic tasks like defining concepts, creating codes, and finding associations. \r\n"

Today, I could really use your help with this evaluation plan I\u2019m working on.\r\n\r\nAbout six months ago, my Commissioner came back from a meeting at the CDC all excited about this new CDC-sponsored smartphone app that a few local health departments out in California have disseminated into their communities with great success. It\u2019s called ShapeTracker, and apparently, people love it. I was tasked with launching this app in our county.\r\n\r\nShapeTracker is a very comprehensive, well-designed, and user-friendly diet and fitness app that features local resources. People use it on their smartphones to track their diet and exercise and to connect to wellness resources in the community. The app is designed to work on all different kinds of smart phones and is very promising because so many people have become regular active users in the pilot communities.\r\n\r\nObesity prevention is a high priority in our health department\u2019s latest strategic plan and the ShapeTracker program is the biggest new obesity initiative we are rolling out. Here are some of the stats we put together on obesity, and also on smartphone use."

I formed a small advisory group of stakeholders, and together we have already put together a logic model and started drafting some evaluation questions. With this kind of new program, which has its skeptics, it\u2019s really important to show whether it is making a positive difference. \r\n\r\nI know we are doing the right things with our evaluation planning so far, but we still have to figure out all the technical parts of the research design.

From this perspective, since the purpose of qualitative research is to describe or understand the phenomena of interest from the participant's eyes, the participants are the only ones who can legitimately judge the credibility of the results.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Transferability</strong></p>\r\n  Transferability refers to the degree to which the results of qualitative research can be generalized or transferred to other contexts or settings. From a qualitative perspective, transferability is primarily the responsibility of the one doing the generalizing. The qualitative researcher can enhance transferability by doing a thorough job of describing the research context and the assumptions that were central to the research. The person who wishes to &quot;transfer&quot; the results to a different context is then responsible for making the judgment of how sensible the transfer is.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dependability</strong></p>\r\n  The idea of dependability emphasizes the need for the researcher to account for the ever-changing context within which research occurs. The researcher is responsible for describing the changes that occur in the setting and how these changes affected the way the researcher approached the study.</p>\r\n<p>The traditional quantitative view of reliability is based on the assumption of replicability or repeatability. Essentially it is concerned with whether we would obtain the same results if we could observe the same thing twice. But we can't actually measure the same thing twice -- by definition if we are measuring twice, we are measuring two different things. In order to estimate reliability, quantitative researchers construct various hypothetical notions (e.g., true score theory) to try to get around this fact.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Confirmability</strong></p>\r\nQualitative research tends to assume that each researcher brings a unique perspective to the study. Confirmability refers to the degree to which the results could be confirmed or corroborated by others. There are a number of strategies for enhancing confirmability. The researcher can document the procedures for checking and rechecking the data throughout the study. Another researcher can take a &quot;devil's advocate&quot; role with respect to the results, and this process can be documented. The researcher can actively search for and describe negative instances that contradict prior observations. And, after the study, one can conduct a data audit that examines the data collection and analysis procedures and makes judgments about the potential for bias or distortion.</p>"

Qualitative and mixed methods\r\n    are mostly used in process evaluation, but they can also be useful in outcome\r\n    evaluation. </p>\r\n  <p>For example, let\u2019s consider our evaluation question whether\r\n    ShapeTracker decreases perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy\r\n    eating. We may not have a clear idea of what specific barriers are important in\r\n    our community and how ShapeTracker can address them. Qualitative methods may be\r\n    well justified for this evaluation question. </p>\r\n  <p>An example of evaluation design would be focus groups with\r\n    ShapeTracker users to discuss challenges to exercising and eating healthy and how\r\n    ShapeTracker has helped them. Systematic qualitative analysis can be used to\r\n    provide evidence of program effectiveness.</p>\r\n  <h3>How do we choose\r\n    among the many options for research design?</h3></br>\r\n  <p>There are many factors to consider. Choosing a design is\r\n    always a matter of finding the right balance of scientific rigor and\r\n    feasibility. We will come back to specific threats to validity and feasibility\r\n    considerations when we discuss the Limitations and Feasibility section of the\r\n    Evaluation Plan.</p>\r\n  <p>It is also important to work with the stakeholders as we\r\n    make decisions about the evaluation design. Please click on the stakeholder\r\n    icon to remind yourself who is in our stakeholder advisory group.</p>\r\n  <p>And remember that the logic model and evaluation questions\r\n    can help us stay focused as we discuss design options.</p>"

Stakeholder input is very important and helpful during instrument design.</p>\r\n<h3>Sampling</h3>\r\n<p> Evaluators also need to define their sampling strategies and sample size requirements. For our primary outcome evaluation design, we are lucky to have access to county-wide household surveys that are designed to reach representative samples of county residents.</p>\r\n<p>Major types of sampling strategies include:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th valign=\"top\" class=\"th1\">Sampling Strategy</th>\r\n    <th valign=\"top\" class=\"th1\">Definition</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n  \r\n  <tr>\r\n   <th valign=\"top\" class=\"th2\">Simple random sampling</th>\r\n    <td valign=\"top\">Every unit has an equal probability of being selected for the sample.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th valign=\"top\" class=\"th2\">Stratified random sampling</th>\r\n    <td valign=\"top\">Random sample that ensures representative samples of subgroups (strata) within the overall sample.

Many tools are available for sample size calculations, although they require some understanding of the principles of statistical inference. This is an area where many evaluators reach out to biostatisticians for help.</p>\r\n<p>A final note about the Evaluation Design section: It is also important to have clear written protocols for data collection activities. These may need to be separate documents outside of the Evaluation Plan. They will list all steps that need to be carried out with each data collection activity, including instructions for recruitment and informed consent.</p>\r\n<p>Now, let's review what we have just discussed about indicators, data collection methods and sampling.</p>"
